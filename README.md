BevInsight AI Copilot is a next-generation, competition-grade AI Business Decision Support Copilot for FMCG beverage companies. Beyond a simple Natural Language to SQL chatbot, BevInsight includes intent resolution, price elasticity forecasting simulations, and explainable AI confidence scores, alongside proactive smart alerts.

Key Advanced Features
Business Metric Resolution Layer: Translates vague retail terms ("fastest growing", "inventory risk", "best promotion") into exact relational database metrics (WoW growth, stockout weeks, promotional uplift).
Decision Simulator (Scenario Engine): Allows users to shift sliders (Promotional Discounts, Safety Stock Levels, Campaign Durations) to model elasticities and predict simulated revenue changes and stockout risks.
Explainability & Confidence Engine: Explains why a query was compiled, which tables were selected, and computes a metric mapping confidence score.
Smart Alerts Engine: Automatically scans SQLite logs to flag critical stockouts, underperforming promotions, and excess inventory risks.
SQL Safety Wrapper: AST-style validation layer blocking SQL injection vectors, stacked queries, and modify commands (DROP, DELETE, UPDATE, INSERT, PRAGMA), enforcing read-only constraints.
Generate Weekly Board Report: Compiles summaries, charts, risk scores, and recommendations into a formatted executive board report printable directly to PDF.

Quick Start Guide
1. Installation
Ensure Python 3.10+ and Node.js are installed. In your terminal:

powershell

# Setup virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Install backend dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Database Initialization
Seed the SQLite database with 24 weeks of FMCG beverage sales:

powershell

python -m app.generator
3. Execution
Start the FastAPI server (it serves the React client directly on root):

powershell

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.

Competition Differentiation (10 Core Pillars)
Explainable AI: Computes a transparent confidence percentage score and prints reasoning paths for audits.
AST SQL Safety Guard: Intercepts raw LLM outputs to block injection attempts and stack query executions.
Resilient Local Fallback: Employs rule-based regex parsers to guarantee dashboard operation during API offline cycles.
Heuristic Simulation: Forecasts elasticity trends dynamically using historical transaction ratios.
Executive Summary Compilation: Automates standard text business briefs directly from database indicators.
FMCG Intent Resolution: Corrects lexical differences (e.g., matching "water volume" to AquaPure Still units).
Proactive Alarm Triggers: Monitors warehouse supply stock buffers and flags overstock risks.
PDF Report Compilation: Connects responsive print sheets to compile presentation memos.
Interactive Dashboard Cards: Merges live conversation windows with dynamic KPI grids and Chart.js displays.
Enterprise Monorepo Split: Provides separate react files alongside monolithic FastAPI deployment bindings.
